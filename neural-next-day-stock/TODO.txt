This file is for ideas related to the project

1) Create a save file package that includes the logs, data, etc. This will make organization much easier.

2) Change the model to judge fitness based on buy and sell orders. Also incorporate shorting.

3) Think of ideas for creating a prediction graph into the future for a week or 2

4) Create a way to make models 'general purpose' so one model can be trained with many datasets
    - Look into different methods of normalization processing

5) Research new techniques for predicting the stock and crypto money markets

6) Consider using neural networks to build other neural networks.
    - The current model only predicts the next day's price, which can be one of the many indicators used
    to make feed into a bot that makes price action decisions.
    - Some neural networks can be built using other neural networks. Look into making a network of various
    neural network models that feeds their output into a final neural network.

7) Refactor and clean up the code. With the previous objectives in mind, think of how the code can be
refactored to make building out new neural networks easier and faster.
